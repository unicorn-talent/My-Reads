## Backend Server

The webApp is fetches its data from a backend server. This means the user's search is dictated by the data the comes from the backend server. To put it in a more clear way the user may not be able the search for every existing books they want. Many of the book topics or words the user is able to search can be found in the [SEARCH_TERMS.md]. Those list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your some of terms don't come back with any results.

## Important
* More importantly any search made will only return a maximum of 20 books. So you could just click on their controls to set any book you want to their desired shelf. For any search made and any results returned,___any book that has been selected before will inform you if it has and which shelf it was set to when selected. 

Enjoy your Book Tracking App!!!
